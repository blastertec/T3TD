# T3TD
T3 cruisers fit command spawner for EVE online Thunderdome tournament server. 
This tool allows you to paste EFT-formatted fit (from Pyfa as well) and create a bunch of chat '/giveitem' commands. Usually fit is divided into portions, since ingame chat supports only 1000 characters or so. After clicking on a chunk of /givitem commands (or fit name) the will be copied to clipboard, so you only gonna need to Ctrl + V ingame. Way faster this way.
